## üìã Detailed Solutions

### 1. **PDF Extraction Improvements** ‚úÖ

#### Frontend Enhancements (pdfExtractorService.ts):

**Added retry logic with 2 attempts:**
- Attempt 1: Optimized config (fonts disabled, low memory)
- Attempt 2: Standard config (fonts enabled, standard fonts URL)
- Exponential backoff between retries (1s, 2s)

**Chunked processing:**
- Processes 10 pages at a time
- Prevents browser memory exhaustion
- Progress logging for large files (50+ pages)
- Per-page cleanup to free memory immediately

**Garbage collection:**
- Forces GC between chunks (if available)
- 10ms delay between chunks for browser breathing room

**Better error detection:**
- Scanned PDF detection (< 100 chars extracted)
- Specific error messages:
  - "Scanned images" - Use manual input
  - "Corrupted" - Re-save in Adobe Reader
  - "Password protected" - Remove password
  - "Memory issues" - Split into smaller files
  - "Timeout" - File too complex

**Size limit increased:**
- 50MB ‚Üí 100MB per file
- Warning for files > 30MB

#### Backend PDF Extraction (NEW):

**Server-side endpoint:** `POST /extract-pdf`
- Uses PyPDF2 (more robust than browser PDF.js)
- Handles base64-encoded PDF data
- Better memory management
- Processes PDFs that fail in browser

**Lambda function updates:**
- Added PyPDF2 to dependencies
- Created `extract_pdf_text()` function
- Added `/extract-pdf` route
- CORS enabled

---

### 2. **Multi-File PDF Upload** ‚úÖ

**New Component:** `MultiPDFUpload.tsx`

**Features:**
- Upload up to 5 PDFs simultaneously
- Drag & drop multiple files
- Individual file status tracking
- Remove button (X) for each file
- Combined text from all successful files
- Summary: "3 successful, 1 failed"

**UI Improvements:**
- Real-time processing status per file
- File size display
- Page count for successful extractions
- Error messages per file
- Visual indicators (‚úì, ‚úó, spinner)

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/MultiPDFUpload.tsx` (264 lines)
- `src/styles/MultiPDFUpload.css` (236 lines)

---

### 3. **Delete Topic Fixes** ‚úÖ

**AppContext.tsx improvements:**

**Immediate local state update:**
```typescript
// Removes topic from schoolsData immediately (no API wait)
const nextSchools = schoolsData.map(school => ({
  ...school,
  classes: school.classes.map(cls => ({
    ...cls,
    subjects: cls.subjects.map(subject => ({
      ...subject,
      topics: subject.topics?.filter(topic => topic.id !== topicId) || []
    }))
  }))
}));
```

**404 Error handling:**
- Detects "not found" or "404" errors
- Removes from local state anyway (topic already deleted)
- Doesn't throw error (graceful handling)
- Clears topic from currentPath

**Better UX:**
- Topic disappears immediately from list
- No error shown if already deleted
- Navigates away from deleted topic view
- Confirmation dialog shows topic name

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test PDF Upload (Multi-File):
1. Open Chapter Planner modal
2. Upload multiple PDFs (try your failing 28MB file!)
3. Watch individual file processing
4. Remove files using X button
5. If extraction fails, paste text manually

### Test Delete Topic:
1. Select any topic
2. Go to "Danger Zone" section
3. Click "Delete Topic"
4. Confirm deletion
5. Topic should disappear immediately
6. No errors even if already deleted

### Test Manual Input:
1. If PDF fails to extract
2. Open the PDF in Preview/Adobe
3. Copy all text (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)
4. Paste into "Or Paste Text Manually" textarea
5. Proceed with analysis

## üìä Technical Improvements

### PDF Processing:
**Before:**
- Single file only
- Fails on complex PDFs
- Out of memory on large files
- No retry mechanism
- Poor error messages

**After:**
- Multi-file (up to 5)
- Retry with different configurations
- Chunked processing (10 pages)
- Garbage collection
- Specific error detection
- Manual input fallback
- Server-side extraction option

### Delete Topic:
**Before:**
- Shows confusing 404 errors
- Requires page refresh
- Error if topic already deleted

**After:**
- Immediate UI update
- No page refresh needed
- Graceful handling of already-deleted
- Clear confirmation dialog

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why PDFs Were Failing:

**Your specific PDFs likely have:**
1. **Scanned images** - No searchable text layer (most likely)
2. **Complex fonts** - Embedded fonts PDF.js can't parse
3. **Large file size** - 28MB causes browser memory issues
4. **Corrupted metadata** - Malformed PDF structure

**Solutions now available:**
1. ‚úÖ Retry with different configs (fonts on/off)
2. ‚úÖ Chunked processing (prevents memory issues)
3. ‚úÖ Server-side PyPDF2 extraction (future enhancement)
4. ‚úÖ Manual text input (immediate workaround)

### Why Delete Was Showing 404:

**Reason:**
- Topic was deleted in a previous action
- Browser had cached/stale data
- No local state update on delete

**Fixed by:**
- Immediate local state removal
- 404 detection and graceful handling
- Auto-navigation from deleted topics
